This project uses session variables to determine a user's log in status and only show the final page if they are properly logged in. Otherwise the html/css is rather simple and the final page just allows the user to select a country from the 2014 World Cup and view their group stage matches from a wikipedia iframe.  The only wrinkle is that it uses HTML5 geolocation if available and the Google Maps API to determine the country the user is viewing the page from.

As of January 2015, the site is still live at: http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~flessnej/CS494/494Project/login.php
Be aware that the api key used for Google maps has expired so this feature no longer works.
